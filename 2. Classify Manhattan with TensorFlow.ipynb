A step in the `fit()` method moves the weights and bias in the neural network only a little in the direction that reduces the network error. However, it usually it takes thousands of steps for neural networks to find the best weights and bias. So, what you are effectively seeing is that the neural network in the initial state (= before the training) acheives a very low accuracy and cannot classify the Manhattan locations properly. "
